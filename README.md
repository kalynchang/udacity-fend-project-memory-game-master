## Game

This was created from the Udacity Front End Nanodegree Memory Game Project starter code.
The game mimics the concentration card game. Players can flip pairs of cards by clicking
on them. If the cards match, then they remain face up. Else, they are flipped back down.
The user wins when all cards remain face up.

If the user completes the game in 10 or less moves, the user will get a star rating of 3.
If the user completes the game in more than 10 but less than 20 moves, the user will get a
star rating of 2. If the user completes the game in over 20 moves, the user will get a star
rating of 1.

A timer feature and a moves counter feature are also provided for the user to understand their
game performance.

## Instructions
Download the repository and open index.html in your browser to load the game and start playing.
